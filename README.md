# Actual_Useful_Things_I_Wrote_In_CSharp
This repo is going to be a mega repo where I keep all the things that are actually working, and kinda useful, and not replacable by any good libraries yet. 

# What it has: 
* A tree implementation of the disjoint set data structure, which is kinda an obscure data structure. 
* Some unfinished but working parallelization tools for parallelizing divide and conquer algorithm. 
--------
Everything has been placed into one project to save some spaces for stuff and shit.
